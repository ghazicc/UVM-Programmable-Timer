# Timer Design Update Summary

## Changes Made Based on Specifications

### 1. DUT (Design/dut.sv) - Completely Rewritten
- **Port Order**: Fixed to match specs: `module timer(d,a,clk,g0,g1,out0,out1)`
- **3-Cycle Write Protocol**: Implemented exact 3-cycle mechanism:
  - Cycle 1: Control register write (address 10)
  - Cycle 2: MSN write with address validation (a[1] == control[3], a[0] == 0)
  - Cycle 3: LSN write with range and mode validation
- **Address Mapping**: 
  - 00: Counter0, 01: Counter1, 10: Control
- **Range Validation**: Counter0 (2-150), Counter1 (50-200)
- **Mode Constraints**: Even for mode 2, odd for modes 3&4
- **Gate Control**: Counters freeze when gates are 0
- **Output Logic**: Outputs are gated by their respective gate signals

### 2. Reference Model (Verification/reference_mode.sv) - Completely Rewritten  
- **Exact DUT Modeling**: Mirrors the 3-cycle write protocol
- **State Tracking**: Tracks cycle_state, temp_control, temp_msn, valid_sequence
- **Validation Logic**: Same range checks and mode constraints as DUT
- **Counter Operation**: Down-counting from max to 1, then reload
- **Output Generation**: Matches all 5 modes with proper duty cycles

### 3. Test Sequences (Verification/Sequences/timer_sequences.sv) - Enhanced
- **3-Cycle Write Helper**: `write_timer_counter()` task implements proper protocol
- **Mode Testing**: Tests all modes with appropriate count values (even/odd)
- **Range Testing**: Tests boundary values for both counters
- **Gate Testing**: Tests enable/disable functionality
- **Protocol Compliance**: All sequences use proper 3-cycle write mechanism

## Key Features Implemented

### 3-Cycle Write Protocol
```
Cycle 1: Write Control (addr=10, data={counter_sel, mode})
Cycle 2: Write MSN (addr={counter_sel,0}, data=count[7:4])
Cycle 3: Write LSN (addr={counter_sel,0}, data=count[3:0])
```

### Mode Behaviors
- **Mode 0**: out = (count == max) - Single high pulse
- **Mode 1**: out = (count != max) - Single low pulse  
- **Mode 2**: out = (count <= max/2) - 50% duty cycle
- **Mode 3**: out = (count > (max+1)/2) - (n-1)/2 high, (n+1)/2 low
- **Mode 4**: out = (count <= (max-1)/2) - (n+1)/2 high, (n-1)/2 low

### Validation Rules
- Counter0: 2 ≤ count ≤ 150
- Counter1: 50 ≤ count ≤ 200  
- Mode 2: count must be even
- Modes 3,4: count must be odd
- Invalid writes are ignored, buffers flushed

## Verification Strategy
- **Protocol Testing**: Verifies 3-cycle write mechanism
- **Mode Coverage**: Tests all 5 modes with valid constraints
- **Boundary Testing**: Tests min/max values for both counters
- **Error Testing**: Tests invalid sequences and out-of-range values
- **Gate Testing**: Verifies freeze/resume functionality

The implementation now fully complies with the detailed specifications provided.
